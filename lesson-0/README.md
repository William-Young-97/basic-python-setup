### Git

**What is it?**

Git provides us with version control. This means we can commit (save) our work whenever we want and return to that point in the future. As you can imagine this is useful for if we make mistakes in our code. It can also be used with GitHub to store code online. Finally, Git allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time.

**Why bother?**

Git is widely used by industry professionals and is an essential developer tool for any beginner to learn. It helps us to track changes in our code over time, and as well as leading to safer projects, it allows multiple people to work on a single project.

**How can we use it?**

- `brew install git` To install Git
- `git init` Initiates a new hidden git repository
- `git commit` Allows you to commit your work (save it)
- `git push` Can push your work up to GitHub

To use `git push` create an account on GitHub and generate an ssh keypair:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

to allow you to securely push your work.

### Testing

**What is it?**

Testing is the practice of ensuring your code works even if changes are made to it. Specifically, unit tests are written to test input vs output. Many languages have many different testing frameworks. For python we will be using pytest. 

**Why bother?**

The benefits of testing are numerous:

- Allows us to refactor and change code whilst ensuring functionality is kept the same.
- Verification that each component of your code works in different situations.
- Helps to guard against programmatic errors.
- Provides a form of documentation for your code base.
- Creates a scalable framework for a your codebase grows and new contributers join.

**How can we use it?**
