### Git

**What is it?**

Git provides us with version control. This means we can commit (save) our work whenever we want and return to that point in the future. As you can imagine this is useful for if we make mistakes in our code. It can also be used with GitHub to store code online. Finally, Git allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time.

**Why bother?**

Git is widely used by industry professionals and is an essential developer tool for any beginner to learn. It helps us to track changes in our code over time, and as well as leading to safer projects, it allows multiple people to work on a single project.

**How can we use it?**

- `brew install git` To install Git
- `git init` Initiates a new hidden git repository
- `git commit` Allows you to commit your work (save it)
- `git push` Can push your work up to GitHub

To use `git push` create an account on GitHub and generate an ssh keypair:

to allow you to securely push your work.
